# SimpleCodes

This is where I put all my practice to document over time.  I am a new Developer going to Full Sail University for a Bachelors of Science in Web Development and Design and just want to get started on practice. 

## Projects in this Code...

### (1) DarkMode Switch

The first project made was this DarkMode switch using HTML CSS and JS.  I created this without using any guides on Javascript which is my first project to do that!
