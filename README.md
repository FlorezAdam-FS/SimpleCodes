# SimpleCodes

This is where I put all my practice to document over time.  I am a new Developer going to Full Sail University for a Bachelors of Science in Web Development and Design and just want to get started on practice. 

## Projects in this Code...

### (1) DarkMode Switch

The first project made was this DarkMode switch using HTML CSS and JS.  I created this without using any guides on Javascript which is my first project to do that! 

### (2) Drawer Menu

The Second project made was this simple drawer menu. Made the links go to my social media. You could add any amount of links in the menu.  The burger Icon will move if the screen size it less than 600 to the bottom right of the screen for ease of use for mobile devices.
