        <h1>Dark Mode Switch</h1>
        <p>This was just a quick development of a DarkMode switch. I saw a couple videos of it on youtube but was
            confused on the way they did it. I decided to just jump in and figure thing out on my own. I am very new to
            coding and after having issues retaining the knowledge I started to just build things and learn through
            trial
            and error. I finally made this, it took me about 30 minutes to figure out the javascript. This is my first
            project I made with javascript completely on my own. I hope you enjoy!</p>
